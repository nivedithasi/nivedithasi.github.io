# The Fridge

It's a wonder that the short silver refrigerator in the corner of my home in Bangalore is still running. It has undergone only one repair over the course of a life that has spanned longer than my own. With its back to the wall, the three exposed sides are plastered with drawings made by me and my little brother over the course of our lives. Potato people, spherical horses, melting cars. Part of me wonders whether the fridge hasn't been thrown out because my mother wouldn't know what to do with all the displaced scribbles. 

I did not stop very often to look at the drawings when I lived at home. But a few weeks ago my mother sent me a picture of the kitchen and I noticed the fridge, feathery with the slips taped to its sides, ready to take flight.

Today my wandering pencil occasionally sketches out a strawberry, daffodil or unicorn along the margins of a notebook or stray Post-It note. But I miss slowly observing and intentionally drawing.
Drawing, for me, is a journey of self-revelation. I discover how my mind registers different facets of the world. It is for the same reason that I love studying student creations from an art class. I am amazed by how different minds work, producing such varied interpretations of the same still scene.
