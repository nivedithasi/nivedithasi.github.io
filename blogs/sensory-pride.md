# Sensory Pride & Prejudice

{dc}It is a truism that wide realms of the world go undetected by any given creature simply
because it lacks the requisite sensory apparatus. Evolution in humans, responding to the
unrelenting demands of natural selection, did not confer many cool capabilites (being able
to see ultraviolet and infrared light also ranks high on my coolness scale) because they
were unnecessary for our survival.

Rudiger Wehner’s "matched filters," [1] provides a conceptual way of thinking about sensory systems.
This filter presents a vastly reduced
model of the external world by excluding most of its information, and thereby simplifying
the analytical tasks that are crucial for an organism’s survival. Much the way we screen out
background chatter in a restaurant to hear only those at our table, filters let in only those
signals that an animal needs to know.

Any sensory apparatus needs energy for its construction and maintenance. So do the neural
circuits that analyse the output of that apparatus. Consider a neuron. At a minimum, the
neuron’s resting potential has to be maintained so that it is ready for signaling and restored
after the signaling. Even more cost is incurred in the signaling itself. ATP molecules have to
be expended to push sodium and potassium ions across the neuronal membrane and
nerotransmitters across synapses. Matched filters, by greatly limiting the information
gathered, save energy that would have otherwise been expended in gathering and
processing inconsequential information.

There is something like capitalism at work here (unsurprising, since capitalism is often
described as Darwinian). Prudent allocation of scarce ATP molecules separates
evolutionary winners from losers. Seeing ultraviolet colors and magnetic fields may be
cool, but if it won’t improve my chances of survival and reproduction, then that ATP budget
is better spent on other things that will. Evolution, like a hard-headed manager, weighs the
benefits of the sensory system against its energetic cost.

How could we move this concept to firmer, quantitative grounds? The law of diminishing
marginal utility is a mainstay of economics. For cost, ATP lends itself naturally as the
currency for energy in the living world. Marginal utility could be the incremental
information the sensory capability gives multpilied by its impact to survival. Information
entropy gives information a rigorous quantitative value. It rests on the fact that answering
a question ultimately reduces to giving a unique pointer to the answer, not necessarily the
detailed answer itself. Since the most basic form of questioning is of the yes/no variety, bits
are commonly used to measure information. One bit is the information contained in the
choice between two equally likely alternatives (such as the outcome of a coin toss). [2]

Therefore, to assess the suitability of investment in a particular sensation one could
measure its benefit by determining the bits of information gained by executing that sensory
task (say the transduction of photons by a photoreceptor in the eye followed by the neural
image processing). And then multiplying that by the “survivability coefficient”associated
with those bits to get a survival-adjusted utility of that sensation. This utility can then be
held against the total number of ATP molecules consumed to generate it. Research so far
seems to have focussed on the denominator of that ratio to show why energy efficient
coding and wiring schemes are found in numerous sensory systems. [3,4]

I can see such an approach being eventually applied to one of my interests, linguistics.
Langage comprehension in humans is probably influenced by the metabolic cost of neural
processing. But, to begin with, it seems more tractable to build a survival-adjusted
Bits/ATP model in simple creatures with small nervous systems and limited energy
budgets, such as invertebrates. Marine biology seems especially suited to this inquiry since
most invertebrates live in water and even many terrestrial invertebrates spend one or
more stages of their lives in water.

Two thousand years ago, the Roman philosopher Plotinus said: “To any vision must be brought an eye adapted to what is to be
seen, and bearing some likeness to it.” Around that time in India, Nāgārjuna, in his treatise
Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, took a rather different view. He asserted that belief in the
objectivity of any phenomenon is overstated because it cannot be disentangled from the
perceptual and cognitive apparatus experiencing it.

Those two men never met. But a great meeting of Indian and western epistemologies
did occur when Albert Einstein and the Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore met in 1930. The
exchange between the two Nobel laureates went something like this [5]:
> Einstein: If there were no humans, would the Apollo Belvedere no longer be beautiful?

> Tagore: No!

> Einstein: I agree with this conception for beauty but not truth.

>Tagore: Why not? Truth is also realized through men. If there be some Truth which has no sensuous or rational relation to the human mind, it will ever remain as nothing so long as we remain human beings.
